        "# Credit Risk Modeling | Part 2: Probability of Default (PD) Model with Machine Learning, Performance Evaluation, Scorecard Development, and Loan Approval Cutoffs\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Probability of Default (PD)\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Probability of Default (PD)** is a fundamental metric in credit risk modeling. It quantifies the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations (such as credit card payments, mortgage, or other loans) within a specified time horizon, typically one year.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In this notebook, we build the PD model using **logistic regression**, a widely-used classification method suitable for modeling binary outcomes (default vs. non-default).\n",
        "* The logistic regression model outputs probabilities bounded between 0 and 1, which we interpret as the borrower's likelihood of default.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, the logistic regression function is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "P(Y=1|X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k X_k)}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $P(Y=1|X)$ is the probability of default given features $X$,\n",
        "* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, and\n",
        "* $\\beta_i$ are the coefficients for features $X_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is trained on historical loan data, learning the relationship between borrower characteristics and default risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Performance Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the PD model’s predictive power, key metrics are calculated, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Accuracy:** The fraction of correct predictions over total predictions.\n",
        "* **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC):** Measures model’s ability to distinguish between defaulters and non-defaulters across various threshold levels. A value above 0.5 indicates better-than-random classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "These metrics guide model selection and tuning, ensuring a reliable probability estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scorecard Development\n",
        "\n",
        "A **credit scorecard** translates the logistic regression outputs into a simple, interpretable scoring system for practical use by credit officers and regulators. Scorecards meet Basel Accord requirements and regulatory expectations, emphasizing clarity and transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why scorecards?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* They discretize continuous variables into bins, facilitating intuitive explanations of risk drivers.\n",
        "* They standardize scores within a fixed range, typically matching the well-known FICO score range of **300 to 850**.\n",
        "* They allow easy communication of risk levels to non-technical stakeholders, enabling informed credit decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scorecard conversion uses the log-odds output from logistic regression and applies scaling factors to map probabilities to scores. The score for an individual attribute bin $i$ is computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Score}_i = \\text{Offset} + \\text{Factor} \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \\right)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $p_i$ is the predicted probability in bin $i$, and the **Factor** and **Offset** are constants chosen to align scores with the desired range.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Loan Approval Cutoffs\n",
        "\n",
        "An essential practical consideration is setting the **loan approval cutoff** score:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Borrowers with scores **above the cutoff** are approved for loans, indicating acceptable credit risk.\n",
        "* Borrowers with scores **below the cutoff** are rejected to mitigate potential losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Determining this cutoff involves balancing:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The institution’s appetite for risk,\n",
        "* The expected proportion of loan approvals versus rejections, and\n",
        "* The economic impact of misclassifications (false positives and false negatives).\n",
        "\n",
        "In formula terms, the cutoff corresponds to a threshold probability $p^*$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "p^* = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\text{Threshold Log-Odds}}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where the threshold log-odds is chosen to optimize business objectives, such as maximizing profit or minimizing loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook covers the end-to-end process of building and validating a **Probability of Default (PD) model** using logistic regression, transforming it into an easy-to-understand scorecard, and establishing practical loan approval cutoffs. These steps empower financial institutions to make data-driven credit decisions that are both compliant with regulatory standards and aligned with business risk preferences.\n",
