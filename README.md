# Credit Risk Modeling | Calculation of PD, LGD, EAD, and EL with Machine Learning in Python

---

## üìö Background

Credit risk modeling is a critical function for financial institutions, representing the risk that borrowers may fail to repay loans, credit cards, or other credit facilities. In many cases, borrowers may only partially repay the principal and interest amounts, increasing the lender‚Äôs exposure to loss. Both traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques play a vital role in managing large datasets and developing accurate predictive models.

This project harnesses advanced data science and machine learning to build comprehensive credit risk models in line with Basel II regulatory requirements, aiming to provide robust risk quantification and actionable scorecards for daily credit decisioning.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end AI-powered credit risk modeling pipeline using Lending Club loan data. The goal is twofold: (1) to generate a practical scorecard for loan approval and risk-based pricing, and (2) to establish a pipeline for calculating exposure loss through integrated risk components.

The process follows a structured, stepwise approach consistent with Basel II standards:

1. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Convert raw loan data into suitable formats, including fine and coarse classing to create dummy variables.
2. **Probability of Default (PD) Modeling:** Develop logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of borrower default.
3. **Scorecard Generation:** Translate the PD model into a user-friendly scorecard CSV for practical credit risk evaluation.
4. **Loss Given Default (LGD) Modeling:** Use beta regression to estimate the proportion of loss if default occurs.
5. **Exposure at Default (EAD) Modeling:** Apply linear regression to forecast exposure at the time of default.
6. **Expected Loss (EL) Calculation:** Integrate PD, LGD, and EAD to quantify expected loss and overall credit risk exposure.
7. **Model Validation and Monitoring:** Assess model stability and performance over time using population stability indices and new data from 2015.

This notebook series includes revisions and additions from the credit risk course on 365 Learning, enhancing the practical and theoretical framework of credit risk analytics.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Lending Club and available on Kaggle, contains over 800,000 consumer loans issued in the US between 2007 and 2015. For modeling, data is split into two periods: 2007-2014 for model training and 2015 for validation and monitoring. This approach simulates real-world deployment and regulatory compliance checks.
