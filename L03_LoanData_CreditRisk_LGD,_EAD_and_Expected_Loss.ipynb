        "After estimating the probability of default (PD) in previous steps, credit risk assessment proceeds with quantifying the **Loss Given Default (LGD)** and **Exposure at Default (EAD)**—the other two core components of expected credit loss.\n",

        "- **Loss Given Default (LGD):**  \n",
        "  LGD represents the proportion of total exposure that is lost if a borrower defaults, after accounting for recoveries.  \n",
        "  $$ \\mathrm{LGD} = 1 - \\mathrm{Recovery\\ Rate} $$\n",
        "  LGD is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 60% means 60 cents lost per dollar at default).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Exposure at Default (EAD):**  \n",
        "  EAD is the total value that the lender is exposed to when the borrower defaults. For term loans, this is usually the outstanding principal at the time of default.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Expected Loss (EL):**  \n",
        "  EL combines all three risk components into a single measure of anticipated loss:  \n",

        "The logistic regression analysis reveals that loan grade is the most influential predictor of recovery probability, with higher grades (A through F) significantly increasing the likelihood of recovery. Notably, loans graded ‘A’ exhibit the strongest positive association with recovery outcomes. Verification status also plays a meaningful role; loans that are “Not Verified” or “Source Verified” are associated with a modest but statistically significant decrease in recovery odds. Additionally, certain loan purposes, such as those for car purchases, home improvements, and major purchases, positively impact recovery probabilities. Conversely, a higher number of total accounts is negatively associated with recovery likelihood, indicating that borrowers with more accounts tend to have lower recovery rates. Several variables, including home ownership types and some purposes like medical or moving, were found to have no statistically significant effect on recovery, suggesting these factors do not meaningfully influence the model’s predictive power. Overall, the model explains important facets of recovery behavior, providing valuable insights for credit risk assessment and decision-making."

        "The linear regression analysis reveals that several loan characteristics significantly influence the recovery rate. Notably, loan grades from A to F generally have a negative impact on recovery, indicating that certain grades are associated with lower recoveries compared to the baseline. Home ownership status also plays a role, with borrowers who do not own a home showing higher recovery rates. However, most loan purposes have little to no significant effect on recovery. Key financial indicators such as the total number of accounts and total revolving credit limit show small but positive associations with recovery, while delinquent accounts have negligible impact. Overall, the model highlights that while some borrower and loan attributes meaningfully affect recovery, others contribute minimally, helping to focus risk management efforts on the most relevant factors.\n"
